# Getting Started with ASCII Code Video
Welcome to the ASCII Code Video project! This guide will help you get started with setting up and running the project locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- Web browser
- Any local server (e.g., [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for Visual Studio Code)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ascii-code-video.git
   
Replace **your-username** with your GitHub username.

## Running the Project
* Start your local server. If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can use the Live Server extension.
* I advice to use [p5.js](https://editor.p5js.org/etutkugayda/sketches/STZ9tNBj1) editor.
* Open the index.html file in your web browser.
* Experience the **magic of ASCII Code Videos**! The preview page should display a real-time ASCII art representation of the video captured from your webcam.
